# Control Flow

Jyro supports control flow through two primary constructs that enable dynamic program execution based on runtime conditions. Conditional execution provides standard if-then-else logic for binary decision making, while multi-way branching offers switch-case statements for efficient handling of multiple discrete conditions. These constructs allow scripts to alter their execution path based on variable values, function results, or other runtime state, enabling the creation of responsive and adaptive automation workflows.
