# Iteration and Looping

Jyro provides iteration capabilities through three complementary mechanisms that enable repetitive execution of code blocks. Collection iteration allows traversal of arrays and other data structures using foreach loops, while conditional iteration supports while loops that execute based on boolean expressions. Loop control statements provide fine-grained control over iteration flow, allowing scripts to exit loops early or skip to the next iteration cycle as needed for complex processing logic.
