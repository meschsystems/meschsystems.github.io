Jyro is an imperative, dynamically-typed interpreted scripting language built for heavy data transformation and processing workflows. Scripts operate on a **mutable data context** supplied by the host, eliminating the complexity of object creation, memory management, and return value handling while supporting full transformation capabilities via **familiar procedural programming constructs**. This architecture makes Jyro ideal for **embedded scripting** scenarios ranging from trusted automation tasks to **untrusted user-generated scripts** in multi-tenant applications, where the **fully isolated execution model** and explicit **host-function allowlisting** prevent privilege escalation and system compromise without sacrificing functionality.
