# Expressions

Jyro expressions form the foundation for data manipulation and logical evaluation within scripts. Expressions combine variables, literals, operators, and function calls to produce computed values that drive program logic and data transformation. The expression system supports standard mathematical operations, string manipulation, logical comparisons, and complex nested evaluations, all governed by a clear precedence hierarchy that ensures predictable and consistent results across all script executions.

Expressions follow standard operator precedence rules organized from lowest to highest precedence. Each level of the hierarchy can contain multiple operators of the same precedence level, which are evaluated left-to-right.
